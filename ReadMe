This week 5 mobile development assignment 
This is a simple mobile app that showcase gridview and a listview with drop down options.
For the items on the list, I used some cities in Rwanda.
You just need to download the 'main' file and run it in the VScode flutter environment to be able to see it.
You can also download the whole project if you want.
